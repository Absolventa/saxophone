## Description

A declarative SAX parsing library backed by Nokogiri or Ox.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sax-machine'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

## Usage

To use **Nokogiri** as a SAX handler:

```ruby
require 'sax-machine'
```

To use **Ox** as a SAX handler:

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ox', '>= 2.1.2'
```

Tell SAXMachine to use Ox:

```ruby
require 'sax-machine'
SAXMachine.handler = :ox
```

Please note that this operation is not thread-safe, so it's better to define
handler at initialization stage and do not change it during runtime.

## Examples

Include `SAXMachine` in any class and define properties to parse:

```ruby
class AtomContent
  include SAXMachine
  attribute :type
  value :text
end

class AtomEntry
  include SAXMachine
  element :title
  # The :as argument makes this available through entry.author instead of .name
  element :name, as: :author
  element "feedburner:origLink", as: :url
  # The :default argument specifies default value for element when it's missing
  element :summary, class: String, default: "No summary available"
  element :content, class: AtomContent
  element :published
  ancestor :ancestor
end

class Atom
  include SAXMachine
  element :title
  # The :with argument means that you only match a link tag
  # that has an attribute of type: "text/html"
  element :link, value: :href, as: :url, with: {
    type: "text/html"
  }
  # The :value argument means that instead of setting the value
  # to the text between the tag, it sets it to the attribute value of :href
  element :link, value: :href, as: :feed_url, with: {
    type: "application/atom+xml"
  }
  elements :entry, as: :entries, class: AtomEntry
end
```

Then parse any XML with your class:

```ruby
feed = Atom.parse(xml_text)

feed.title # Whatever the title of the blog is
feed.url # The main URL of the blog
feed.feed_url # The URL of the blog feed

feed.entries.first.title # Title of the first entry
feed.entries.first.author # The author of the first entry
feed.entries.first.url # Permalink on the blog for this entry
feed.entries.first.summary # Returns "No summary available" if summary is missing
feed.entries.first.ancestor # The Atom ancestor
feed.entries.first.content # Instance of AtomContent
feed.entries.first.content.text # Entry content text
```

You can also use the elements method without specifying a class:

```ruby
class ServiceResponse
  include SAXMachine
  elements :message, as: :messages
end

response = ServiceResponse.parse("
  <response>
    <message>hi</message>
    <message>world</message>
  </response>
")
response.messages.first # hi
response.messages.last  # world
```

To limit conflicts in the class used for mappping, you can use the alternate
`SAXMachine.configure` syntax:

```ruby
class X < ActiveRecord::Base
  # This way no element, elements or ancestor method will be added to X
  SAXMachine.configure(X) do |c|
    c.element :title
  end
end
```
